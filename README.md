## About

This world cup tracker was built after one week of studying html and css. I had a week's break, from my bootcamp course. I wanted to build something so I could practice what I had learned, and everyone was talking about the World Cup, so I made this, for my friends and family to track the world cup.
After a bit of researching I found a [repo](https://github.com/lipis/flag-icons) on github that contained flag icons, which could be used via a cdn.
I made some divs for each date, and inside them I put more divs for each game in a grid format. I researched how to make it responsive, (using media queries), so friends could keep track on a mobile.

### Lessons

I found out cdns and media queries work. I do have to keep updating the html though, after every game, which hopefully in the future, I'll be able to fix. I might make another one for the next world cup (2026) and compare my skills. This has been a good project, and it gave me a lot of coding experience, whilst keeping up to date with the world cup games. I now know the command lines of how to push to github, and could do it in my sleep, and my friends all now know that I am learning how to build websites!
